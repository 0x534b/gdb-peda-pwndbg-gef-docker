# The Original Repo

I did not create this. See the original repo here: https://github.com/apogiatzis/gdb-peda-pwndbg-gef

## Pwndbg + GEF + Peda - One for all, and all for one

This is a script which installs Pwndbg, GEF, and Peda GDB plugins in a single command.

Run `install.sh` and then use one of the commands below to launch teh corresponding GDB environment:

```
gdb-peda
gdb-pwndbg
gdb-gef
```
